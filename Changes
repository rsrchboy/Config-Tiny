Revision history for Perl extension Config::Tiny

2.01 Thu Mar 24 2005
	- Lars Thegler noted in CSS::Tiny that 3-argument open is not
	  supported by 5.005. Added a small fix to change it to 2-argument
	  open.

2.00 Fri Jul 16 2004
	- Final tweaks to round out complete 5.004 and Win32 compatibility

1.9  Wed Jul  7 2004
	- Applied some small optimisations from Japheth Cleaver

1.8  Wed Jun 30 2004
	- Fixed a bug whereby trying to load an empty file returned an error,
	  when it should be valid (if an empty object)

1.7  Tue Jun 22 2004
	- Added a little more flexibility in the 'read' and 'read_string' methods
	  to handle being called in unexpected, but recoverable, ways.

1.6  Mon Mar  1 2004
	- Bug fix: Sections without keys didn't appear at all in the parsed struct

1.5  Wed Jan  7 2004
	- Updating documentation to provide a correct location to send bug reports

1.4  Web Dec 24 2003
	- Caught a warning when trying to parse an undefined string.
	  Returns undef in that case.
	- Merry Christmas and a productive New Year to you all!

1.3  Fri Nov 7 2003
	- Slightly altered a regex so that trailing whitespace in properties
	  is dropped.

1.2  Wed Aug 12 15:51:12 2003
	- Applied a variety of small changed designed to reduce the number of
	  opcodes generated, without changing the functionality.
	  This should save a few K in load overhead.

1.1  Wed Apr 23 22:56:21 2003
	- When reporting a bad line, put single quotes around the
	  lines contents in the error message.
	- Small updates to the pod documentation

	- Removed file locking, since we read/write virtually atomically now
	- Removed mode support from ->write() it was erroneous
	- Removed dependency on Fcntl
	- Added the read_string() method
	- Other minor tweaks to shrink the code

0.3  Mon Dec 09 00:44:21 2002
	- Upgraded tests to Test::More, to deep test the structs
	- Added Fcntl to the required modules

0.2  Tue Nov 26 21:51:34 2002
	- Don't import Fcntl symbols
